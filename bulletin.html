              <h4><b>Artificial Intelligence</b></h4> 
              <p>Artificial Intelligence has become an integral tool for all web users, whether it is Chatgpt or Gemini,
                people use it for several reasons from creating content to videos.
                <br><br>
                Artificial Intelligence is more helpful when it comes to web development as it studies
                massive data sets, predicts the results and arrives at logical conclusions.
                <br><br>
                This technology also analyzes the behavior of users and empowers web developers to make decisions
                for the future, making the sites more responsive and informative.
              </p> 
              <h4>Here are some common uses of AI in web development:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Code Generation</li>
                <li>Content Generation</li>
                <li>Testing and Debugging</li>
                <li>Security</li>
                <li>Design Assistance</li>

              <h4><b>API-first Development</b></h4> 
              <p>As the name suggests, APIs are treated with high priority in API-first development.
                <br><br>
                As new technologies emerge, it is necessary to establish a connection between them, and the APIs facilitate these connections.
                <br><br>
                APIs have been around for nearly 20 years.
                <br><br>
                But, earlier, developers used to focus on product development first, and the need to establish a connection with software and devices came as an afterthought.  
                <br><br>
                However, API-first development has major benefits â€“ the most important being it is user-focused.
                <br><br>
                The method allows developers to work in parallel, reducing development time and costs.
                <br><br>
                Web application design, development, and security can all be enhanced with the help of the API-first model.
                <br><br>
                Moreover, it reduces the risk of failure of a project ensuring that all the APIs are reliable and consistent.
                <br><br>
                Thus, API-first development is becoming a major trend in web development nowadays.
